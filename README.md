# Physics
- A summary of some major physics labs/projects that I have worked on.
1. [Asteroid 16 Psyche Light Curve Analysis](1_16_psyche)
- We studied the light curve of asteroid 16 Psyche, revealing a rotation period of about 4.07 hours. Employing the iTelescope network and IRIS software, our analysis demonstrated a robust methodology, providing accurate results despite potential external influences. This contributes valuable insights into 16 Psyche's rotational dynamics, aligning with NASA's reported rotation period. The entire writeup can be found [here](1_16_psyche/315_final_report.pdf).

3. [Square Step Potential](3_square_step_potential)
- Investigated quantum behavior in a square step potential with varying heights (εs). Utilized finite differences for numerical analysis in three cases: εs < 0, 0 > εs > −U0, and εs > U0. Results show distinct wavefunction shifts based on εs values. Analytical validation aligns with numerical findings. Insights into potential applications in diverse dimensions and quantum systems.
