# Physics
- A summary of some major physics labs/projects
1. [Coupled Oscillators](1_fourier_analysis)
- This experiment investigates coupled oscillators, comparing uncoupled and coupled modes at +100 and -100. Uncoupled oscillators follow natural frequencies, while coupled systems exhibit dual frequencies. Experimental results include frequency approximations, Lorentzian fits, and graphical analyses. Findings demonstrate the impact of coupling strength on frequency splitting, establishing a concise model for systems with two distinct frequencies. The entire writeup can be found [here](1_fourier_analysis/PHYS250_Formal_Report.pdf).
2. [Square Step Potential]()
- Investigated quantum behavior in a square step potential with varying heights (εs). Utilized finite differences for numerical analysis in three cases: εs < 0, 0 > εs > −U0, and εs > U0. Results show distinct wavefunction shifts based on εs values. Analytical validation aligns with numerical findings. Insights into potential applications in diverse dimensions and quantum systems.
